# Write a Python procedure fix_machine to take 2 string inputs

# as many times as necessary to create the 2nd string (you
# don't need to keep track of repeat usage).

# You are in the middle of a jungle. 
# Suddenly you see an animal coming to you. 
# Here is what you should do if the animal is:

# zebra >> "Try to ride a zebra!"
# cheetah >> If you are faster than a cheetah: "Run!" 
#            If you are not: "Stay calm and wait!". 
#            The speed of a cheetah is 115 km/h.
# anything else >> "Introduce yourself!"

# Define a procedure, jungle_animal, 
# that takes as input a string and a number, 
# an animal and your speed (in km/h), 
# and prints out what to do.

# A year that is a multiple of 4 is a leap year unless the year is
# divisible by 100 but not a multiple of 400 (so, 1900 is not a leap
